# react-image-snipper

Image cropper component for React.

This is a refactor of [react-image-cropper](https://github.com/jerryshew/react-image-cropper) with a Storybook development setup and cleaner API.

## Development

This repo uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as the development setup and NPM as the package manager. Yarn lockfiles are not committed to the repo.

1. `git clone git@github.com:liaujianjie/react-image-snipper.git` to clone this repo
2. Ensure you are running a compatible Node.js and NPM version (tested on Node.js 10.2.1 and NPM 6.1.0)
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm start` to start Storybook
